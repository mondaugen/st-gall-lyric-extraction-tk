Figured out how to install the toolkit.
What's odd is that it seems like the toolkit must be install using the
command:

CFLAGS="-I/Users/nickesterer/Documents/development/Gamera/include" sudo python \
setup.py build && sudo python setup.py install && sudo python setup.py install_scripts;

and you can't use

pip install -e .

(although now that I think of it it might work if you specify the CFLAGS
properly)

But what makes me talk about this is that I was having trouble installing
gamera version 3.3.3 from source using the sudo python setup.py build ... etc
commands and instead had to use the pip method. The problem I was having was
that it would appear to install but then would not find the module when
running

from gamera.core import *

In the more recent case of installing the plugin, I would have a similar
problem in that it would not find the module when running

from gamera.toolkits import st_gall_lyric_extraction

Note that I am installing into a virtual environment (created with
virtualenv).

Just thought I'd write that down.
